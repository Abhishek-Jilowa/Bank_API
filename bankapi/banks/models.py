# # This is an auto-generated Django model module.
# # You'll have to do the following manually to clean this up:
# #   * Rearrange models' order
# #   * Make sure each model has one field with primary_key=True
# #   * Make sure each ForeignKey and OneToOneField has `on_delete` set to the desired behavior
# #   * Remove `managed = False` lines if you wish to allow Django to create, modify, and delete the table
# # Feel free to rename the models, but don't rename db_table values or field names.
